# Interactive Atlanta Map

We created a dashboard for users looking for information about metro Atlanta counties.

The user selects the county, and finds an interactive map with county outlines, the county seat, grocery stores, and MARTA stations.

The card below the selection populates with statistics about the county related to crime, schools, income, etc.

There is also a bubble chart showing school data: SAT, ACT, and CCRPI scores.
